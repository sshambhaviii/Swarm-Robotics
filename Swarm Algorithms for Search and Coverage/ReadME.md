### Swarm Algorithms for Search and Coverage <br>
Our aim was to consider the problem of exploring an unknown environment with a swarm of robots. As in single robot exploration the goal is to minimize the overall exploration time while encountering obstacles of undefined shapes and sizes in path. <br> The multi-robot search and coverage algorithms handle how teams of robots cover the entire accessible area in the least amount of time while avoiding obstacles and detecting goals and reporting their locations. <br> As we use a swarm of robots, the time taken to cover the entire accessible area is greatly reduced and efficiency is thus greatly increased
