We present an intutive approach for the coordination of multiple robots.Our approach is inspired from a single robot coverage algorithm, which divides the target two-dimensional space into regions called cells, each of which can be covered. Single robot coverage is achieved by ensuring that the robot visits every cell. <br>
The new multi-robot search and coverage algorithm uses the same cell-based approach, i.e. a search bot should move to the nearest unvisited cell, but provides extensions to handle how teams of robots cover the entire accessible area in the least amount of time while avoiding obstacles and detecting goals and reporting their location. As we use a swarm of robots, the time taken to cover the entire accessible area is greatly reduced and efficiency is thus greatly increased
